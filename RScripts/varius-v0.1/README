This is the alpha release of the VARIUS variation model.

The core is written for the R statistical package, which can be
downloaded here: http://www.r-project.org/

This package contains the following files:

spatial-grid.R - Implements the functions to generate systematic
                 variation maps with a spherical correlation
                 function. The output format is a matrix of points.

spatial-blocks.R - Implements the functions to generate systematic
                   variation maps at the level of processor functional
                   blocks. Takes a Hotspot-type floorplan as
                   input. Returns a data frame containing the mean Vt
                   and Leff values for each unit in the floorplan.

delay.R - Implements the VARIUS timing error model. 

Also included are two examples of how two use the model.

example-grid.R - uses spatial-grid.R to generate variation maps.

example-block.R - uses spatial-blocks.R to generate block-level
                  variation maps. It then applies the VARIUS timing
                  error model to each unit and plots a collection of
                  error rate versus frequency curves --- one for each
                  functional unit.
